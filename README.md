# Matlab
Brain Tumor Detection
There are two main objectives of this project:
  To detect if there is a tumor in a given MRI image
  If present, to specify its location
Along with this, we have made use of the Anisotropic Diffusion Filter in order to take care of two situations â€“
  When the image is blurry
  When the tumor is of a small size
